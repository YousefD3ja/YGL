# What is this
**this is a simple block-based game.

# About this game
## i just wanted to learn opengl, and this is what i made.

* it's not memory efficient (it will consume your memory like a black hole).
* is uses multiple threads (some of them probably has no purpose).
* lastly, it has a lot of bugs.

## if you want to play
* press "T" to place blocks.
* press "R" to remove blocks.
* press from 1 to 4 to select a block (1:grass, 2:dirt, 3:wood, 4:stone).
* press CTRL to move faster.
* wait for about 15~20 seconds before moveing to avoid potential bugs.
* have fun
